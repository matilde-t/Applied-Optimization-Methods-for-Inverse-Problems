## Part 1: Proximal operators

I decided to put all these proximal operators in a class, that only acts as a collection so that they don't get confused with their respective functions. The class is implemented in `ProximalOperators.py`.

Here are the plots of these operators in the interval $[-10, 10]$, with various values of sigma when applicable.
